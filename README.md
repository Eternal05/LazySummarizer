# LazySummarizer
LazySummarizer and Analyzer is a chrome extension that scrapes the webpage you're on and uses Python's NLTK library and NLP to pick the best sentences to summarize the article, and analyzes it by picking out keywords (Named Entity Recognition) and paraphrasing it using chunking and tagging to determine which words are nouns, verbs, etc. and finding synonyms for them using wordnets.
